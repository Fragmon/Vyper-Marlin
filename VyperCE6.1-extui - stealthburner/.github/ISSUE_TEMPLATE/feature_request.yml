        ## Before Requesting a Feature

        - Read and understand Marlin's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/blob/master/.github/code_of_conduct.md). You are expected to comply with it, including treating everyone with respect.

        - Test with the [`extui` branch](https://github.com/CR6Community/Marlin/archive/extui.zip) or [the latest prerelease](https://github.com/CR6Community/Marlin/releases/) to see whether the issue still exists.

        - Before you proceed with your request, please consider if it is necessary to make it into a firmware feature, or if it may be better suited for a slicer or host feature. Or if the feature is actually something that belongs to Marlin itself.
